#   Basic Select Operations
The basic SELECT statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from a database. Here's a simple example of the SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

Explanation:

- `SELECT`: Keyword used to retrieve data from a database.
- `column1, column2, ...`: The columns you want to retrieve data from. You can specify specific column names or use `*` to select all columns.
- `FROM`: Keyword used to specify the table name from which you want to retrieve data.
- `table_name`: The name of the table where the data resides.

Example:

Let's consider a table named `employees` with columns `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`. To select all columns from the `employees` table, the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

If you want to select only specific columns like `first_name` and `email`, the query would be:

```sql
SELECT first_name, email FROM employees;
```

Additionally, you can use some additional clauses with the SELECT statement:

- `WHERE`: Allows you to specify conditions to filter rows.
- `ORDER BY`: Sorts the result set based on specified columns.
- `GROUP BY`: Groups the result set by specified columns.
- `HAVING`: Applies a condition to the grouped rows.
- `LIMIT`: Limits the number of rows returned.

Here's an example using the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

This query retrieves all columns from the `employees` table where the `department` column equals `'Sales'`.

These are the fundamental operations for selecting data in SQL.
