# Advanced Join Operations in SQL

Advanced join operations in SQL provide additional capabilities beyond basic joins, allowing for more complex data retrieval and manipulation. These operations include CROSS JOIN, Self Join, NATURAL JOIN, and APPLY.

## CROSS JOIN

The CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of two tables, generating all possible combinations of rows from both tables.

### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

### Example:
Suppose we have two tables, `products` and `customers`. To retrieve all possible combinations of products and customers, we can use a CROSS JOIN.

```sql
SELECT products.product_name, customers.customer_name
FROM products
CROSS JOIN customers;
```

## Self Join

A self join is a join that is used to join a table to itself. It is useful for comparing rows within the same table.

### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT a.columns, b.columns
FROM table_name a, table_name b
WHERE a.common_column = b.common_column;
```

### Example:
Suppose we have a table named `employees` containing employee information including a column named `manager_id` that refers to another employee in the same table who is the manager of the current employee. To retrieve the name of each employee along with the name of their manager, we can use a self join.

```sql
SELECT e1.employee_name AS employee, e2.employee_name AS manager
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

## NATURAL JOIN

The NATURAL JOIN performs a join by implicitly matching columns with the same name in two tables.

### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
NATURAL JOIN table2;
```

### Example:
Suppose we have two tables, `employees` and `departments`, both containing a column named `department_id`. To retrieve all employees along with their respective department information using the common column `department_id`, we can use a NATURAL JOIN.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
NATURAL JOIN departments;
```

## APPLY (CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY)

APPLY is used to apply a table-valued function to each row of the outer table expression. SQL Server supports two types of APPLY: CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY.

### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
CROSS APPLY function(table1.column) AS alias;

SELECT columns
FROM table1
OUTER APPLY function(table1.column) AS alias;
```

### Example:
Suppose we have a table-valued function named `getOrders` that returns orders for a given customer ID. To retrieve all customers along with their respective orders using the `getOrders` function, we can use CROSS APPLY.

```sql
SELECT customers.customer_id, orders.order_id
FROM customers
CROSS APPLY getOrders(customers.customer_id) AS orders;
```


Advanced join operations in SQL provide powerful capabilities for querying and analyzing data from multiple tables, enabling complex data retrieval and manipulation.

   You are given a table, Projects, containing three columns: Task_ID, Start_Date and End_Date. It is guaranteed that the difference between the End_Date and the Start_Date is equal to 1 day for each row in the table.

   <img src="./assets/SQL_Project_Planning.png" alt="Table" style="height:100%; width:60%">

   If the End_Date of the tasks are consecutive, then they are part of the same project. Samantha is interested in finding the total number of different projects completed.

   Write a query to output the start and end dates of projects listed by the number of days it took to complete the project in ascending order. If there is more than one project that have the same number of completion days, then order by the start date of the project.
