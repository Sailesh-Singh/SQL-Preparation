# Aggregation and its Operations

### What is Aggregation?

Aggregation in SQL refers to the process of summarizing and combining multiple rows of data into a single result. It involves the use of aggregate functions to perform calculations on groups of rows, returning a single value for each group. Common aggregate functions include COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX.

### Aggregate Functions:

1. **COUNT():** Returns the number of rows in a result set or the number of non-null values in a column.

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;
   ```

2. **SUM():** Calculates the sum of values in a numeric column.

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(sales_amount) FROM sales_data;
   ```

3. **AVG():** Calculates the average of values in a numeric column.

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
   ```

4. **MIN():** Returns the minimum value in a column.

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT MIN(order_date) FROM orders;
   ```

5. **MAX():** Returns the maximum value in a column.

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT MAX(order_date) FROM orders;
   ```

### Grouping Data:

Grouping data allows you to partition the result set into groups based on one or more columns and then perform aggregate calculations on each group.

**GROUP BY Clause:**
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

### Filtering Grouped Data:

You can further filter aggregated data using the HAVING clause. It works similarly to the WHERE clause but is used with aggregate functions.

**HAVING Clause:**
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
```

### Advanced Aggregation Techniques:

1. **Rollup:**
   The ROLLUP operator generates subtotals and a grand total for each group in a result set.

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT department, city, SUM(sales_amount)
   FROM sales_data
   GROUP BY ROLLUP(department, city);
   ```

2. **Cube:**
   The CUBE operator produces a result set that represents all possible combinations of grouping sets.

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT department, city, SUM(sales_amount)
   FROM sales_data
   GROUP BY CUBE(department, city);
   ```

### Window Functions:

Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row within a query result. They are used with an OVER clause to define the window of rows over which the calculation is performed.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT department, salary,
       AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS avg_salary
FROM employees;
```

Aggregation operations in SQL are crucial for data analysis, reporting, and decision-making tasks, enabling users to derive meaningful insights from large datasets.
